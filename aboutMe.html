    <p>
      I am a self-taught Web Developer and UX Designer. But dont let that fool
      you! The fact that I am self taught proves that I am dedicated and
      persistent in my search for information, instruction and applying that
      information in a way that is functional and beautful. It also shows that I
      problem solve and do NOT give up until I figure it out. I am very
      compassionate and dedicated to designing and building fucntional web sites
      and applications. I love to solve problems, research information and data,
      put that information together in a thoughtful and functional way.
    </p>

    <p>I am deeply compassionate about mental health and self improvement.</p>
